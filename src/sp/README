To run my program you must run it through launcher or main class and the application will appear on your screen. 
Throughout the game, as you make moves you will be prompted messages in the console.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you click on the panel you will be prompted to keep going. If you try to make an invalid move you will be promted 
	to keep going however nothing will change in your puzzle. If you make a valid move the move counter will increase 
	by one. If you wish to reset the puzzle, left click on the reset button and the puzzle will return to the starting
	configuration and the counter will return back to zero.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you win the game you will be prompted that you have won in the console and you may not make any further moves.
	In the case that the user wins, the whole application will be disabled and you may close the application with 
	the "X" command in the top-right of the application and try to solve the puzzle again by running the program again.
	
	In order to win the game you must put the board in the winning configuration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
If you lose the game you will be prompted that you have lost in the console and you may not make any further moves.
	In the case that the user loses, the whole application will be disabled and you may close the application with 
	the "X" command in the top-right of the application and try to solve the puzzle again by running the program again.
	
	In order to lose the game you will need to have four of the same number pieces on your board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 
	I attempted to just disable the panel and not the whole application by using "app.panel.setEnabled(false);", 
	however I kept getting errors for this simple command that should have done the job. Instead I disabled the 
	whole application.
